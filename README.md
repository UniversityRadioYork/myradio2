# MyRadio^2

The on-going rewrite of the front-end of our radio management system, MyRadio.

## Status

MyRadio2 has not seen any serious work in almost a year, owing to its immense scope and the fact that only one person was working on it. It can be considered, for all intents and purposes, abandoned.

If future Computing Team members want to un-archive the repo and try and get it somewhere, feel free to! But no serious work will be done it by the current team in the immediate future.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`
